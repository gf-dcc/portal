<h3>
    Joan S. Brugge, PhD - Devising new strategies to track and prevent breast
    cancer development in BRCA mutation carriers
</h3>

<p>
    <!--<img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />-->
    The overall goal of this project is to better understand the earliest stages
    of BRCA cancer development, in order to design strategies to prevent its
    progression to frank cancer.
</p>

<h3>
    Leif W. Ellisen, MD, PhD - Dissecting early pathogenesis of
    BRCA1/2-associated cancer for risk prediction and prevention
</h3>

<p>
    <!--<img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />-->
    The overarching goal of this proposal is to gain better molecular knowledge
    of early lesions in order to improve prediction, early detection and cancer
    prevention for BRCA mutation carriers
</p>

<h3>
    Lewis C. Cantley, PhD - Identification and Targeting of Post-Translationally
    Modified Neoantigens Presented in BRCA Mutant Tumors
</h3>

<p>
    <!--<img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />-->
    The goal of this proposal is to better understand the immune status of BRCA
    tumors in order to target them using a cancer vaccine (or other
    immunotherapy approaches).
</p>

<h3>
    Charis Eng, MD, PhD - Interplay and perturbations of the local microbiome
    and host immune system in breast cancer
</h3>

<p>
    <!--<img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />-->
    The overall goal of this proposal is to better understand how microbes and
    the immune system interact and how this affects the development of BRCA
    breast cancers.
</p>

<h3>
    Victor Velculescu, MD, PhD - Early detection of cancer in high-risk BRCA
    mutation carriers using liquid biopsies
</h3>

<p>
    <!--<img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />-->
    The goal of this project is to develop a sensitive blood test that will
    allow the detection of early BRCA cancers.
</p>

<h3>
    Katherine L. Nathanson, MD - Determinants of immune activity and molecular
    features in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers
</h3>

<p>
    <!--<img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />-->
    This project aims at creating a biorepository that will allow a better
    understanding of the interplay between molecular features and immunogenicity
    in BRCA1/2-associated breast cancer, which represents critical information
    in the design of novel therapies.
</p>

<h3>
    Patrick Sung, PhD - Dissection of BRCA-mediated Tumor Suppression Pathways
</h3>

<p>
    <!--<img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />-->
    The goal of this project is to better understand how BRCA-mediated defects
    in DNA repair mechanisms give rise to cancer and later to resistance to
    standard therapy.
</p>

<h3>
    Ronny Drapkin, MD, PhD &amp; Charles Drescher, MD - Generating and
    incorporating ovarian cancer data to Gray Foundation pre-cancer BRCA Atlas
</h3>

<p>
    <!--<img class="headshot" src="/Ethan-Cerami-SOG_6552_18-e1561395298422.webp" />-->
    The overall goal of this proposal is to generate genomic, transcriptomic,
    and imaging data on early BRCA ovarian lesions to be incorporated into the
    Gray BRCA Precancer Atlas.
