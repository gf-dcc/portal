# Gray Foundation Data Portal (in development)

This repo contains the source code for the Gray Foundation Data Portal.

## Framework

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)

## Backend

Data comes from [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/). A script generates a JSON file that contains all the metadata. There is currently no backend, it's a fully static site, i.e. all filtering happens on the frontend.

### Update Data Files

You can start editing any page. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
